This repository contains two separate Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a submission for the competition. The goal is to analyze the dataset, apply different modeling approaches, and optimize performance for the best results.

### Notebook 1: Neural Network Approach
This notebook leverages neural networks for predicting outcomes, covering key areas such as:

- Exploratory data analysis using basic descriptive statistics.
- Data cleaning by excluding suspicious features and balancing the target dataset.
- Significance testing through non-parametric statistical tests to evaluate feature importance.
- Essential preprocessing steps to scale and encode the data for neural network suitability.
- Neural network training with backpropagation.
- Model evaluation through metrics calculation, confusion matrix visualization, and ROC curve plotting.

### Notebook 2: Machine Learning Approach
The second notebook employs traditional machine learning techniques and places greater emphasis on feature retention and selection. Key aspects include:

- More detailed data exploration and cleaning processes.
- Retention of features instead of merely dropping suspicious data.
- grid searching the hyperspace of sklearn algos.
- Enhanced model performance and predictive results.

## Conclusion
Both notebooks provide different perspectives on tackling the competition problem, demonstrating various methodologies and approaches to achieve optimal results. Feel free to explore the notebooks and adapt them for your own analysis.

Good luck, and thank you for visiting!
