## Contents
1. **Data overview** <br> _We begin this study by conducting an exploratory analysis of the raw dataset using basic descriptive statistics to get a quick sense of the data._
2. **Data Cleaning** <br> _We then proceed to exclude suspicious features and employ a straightforward approach to achieve a balanced target dataset quickly._
3. **Significance tests** <br> _Next, we apply non-parametric statistical tests to assess the significance of features, relying on the large training sample to handle the majority of the work._
4. **Preprocessing** <br> _Subsequently, essential preprocessing steps are implemented to scale and encode the data into a format suitable for neural network._
5. **Deep Learning** <br> _Neural network weights estimation with backpropagation._
6. **Evaluation** <br> _Metrics calculation, visualizing the confusion matrix, and plotting the ROC curve to assess its predictive capability._
