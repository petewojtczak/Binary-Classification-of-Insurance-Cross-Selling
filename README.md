# Kaggle Competition Submissions

Welcome to my Kaggle competition repository! This repository contains two separate Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a submission for the competition. The goal is to analyze the dataset, apply different modeling approaches, and optimize performance for the best results.

## Submission Notebooks

### Notebook 1: Neural Network Approach
This notebook focuses on leveraging neural networks for predicting outcomes based on the dataset. It includes the following sections:

1. **Data Overview**  
   _We begin this study by conducting an exploratory analysis of the raw dataset using basic descriptive statistics to get a quick sense of the data._

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   _We then proceed to exclude suspicious features and employ a straightforward approach to achieve a balanced target dataset quickly._

3. **Significance Tests**  
   _Next, we apply non-parametric statistical tests to assess the significance of features, relying on the large training sample to handle the majority of the work._

4. **Preprocessing**  
   _Subsequently, essential preprocessing steps are implemented to scale and encode the data into a format suitable for neural network._

5. **Deep Learning**  
   _Neural network weights estimation with backpropagation._

6. **Evaluation**  
   _Metrics calculation, visualizing the confusion matrix, and plotting the ROC curve to assess its predictive capability._

### Notebook 2: Machine Learning Approach
The second notebook employs traditional machine learning techniques and places greater emphasis on feature retention and selection. Key aspects include:

- More detailed data exploration and cleaning processes.
- Retention of features instead of merely dropping suspicious data.
- Enhanced model performance and predictive results.

## Conclusion
Both notebooks provide different perspectives on tackling the competition problem, demonstrating various methodologies and approaches to achieve optimal results. Feel free to explore the notebooks and adapt them for your own analysis.

Good luck, and thank you for visiting!
